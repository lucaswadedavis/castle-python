# Castle.io Python Library

To verify, add your `app_id`, `api_secret`, and a fake `user_id` in the appropriate places in `flask_demo_server.py`. Start it up with `python flask_demo_server.py` and visit `localhost:8181`. Refresh the page so Castle has a chance to recognize the cookie, and verify through Castle's dashboard that a user with your fake id has been tracked.
